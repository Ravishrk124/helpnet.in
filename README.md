## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Leaflet.js** – Interactive maps
- **Geolocation API** – Detects user location
- **Network Information API** – Adapts UI for slow connections
- **LocalStorage API** – Stores user post history
- **Intersection Observer API** – (ready for scroll animations)
- *(Optional)* Gemini / ChatGPT AI (currently disabled)

## 🗺️ How It Works

1. The user allows location access.
2. The map centers around them, and dummy posts appear.
3. Users can:
   - Post "Need", "Offer", or "Alert"
   - Filter posts
   - React or respond to others
4. App adapts based on network type (shows/hides map).
5. History, theme, and post data are saved locally.
